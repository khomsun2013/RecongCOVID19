# RecongCOVID19
Phase 1: Identify if the virus image is or is not COVID-19. 

In the first phase, we should be able to recognize the virus image of COVID-19 correctly. The first phase is divided into 

1.1 Data Preparation, the propose is to create dataset for our project. 

1. We should understand about "What is the virus?" from the public data sources such as (https://www.burrosabio.net/definition-virus-work/)
2. We will download the images of corona virus from the public data sources such as http://www.cdc.gov, http://www.google.com 
(search "image of coronavirus").
3. We will download the images of non-corona virus such as HIV, Hepatitis B, Influenza, Rota virus, etc. from the public data 
sources such as http://www.google.com (search "image of HIV virus").
4. We will gather all images from the varity of sources and classify into training dataset and testing dataset.

1.2 Investigate Convolution Neural Networks(CNNs) Techniques and other Image Processing Techiques to help us to achieve the goal.
For example, OpenCV, Tensorflow, and other BigData Techniques.

1.3 Do many experiments with our dataset, and report the results. We also choose the optimization techique for our project.

1.4 Present and publish the results.
